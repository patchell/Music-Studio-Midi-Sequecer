Song and Midi Files for demo or example:

-----------	Note: All .SNG and .MID files are voiced for the Roland
		Sound Canvas SC55.  They will not sound correctly if
		played on another Midi Keyboard or Sound Module.

BATMAN.SNG	Sample Song File  'BATMAN the Movie'  Opening theme uses
		controllers and tries to mimic the movie.  The rest is only
		fair, but is an example of use of Banks to achieve more than
		15 voices.

BEEPBEEP.SNG	Sample Song File   Cute song that demos some of the Roland
		sound effects (cars, dogs, laughter, train, crash, etc.)
		Uses CM64/32L (MT32 Drums with Sound Effects) drum preset.

CATHYS3.SNG	Sample Song File    Demos use of Midi Controllers, Tempo
		and Key Changes in Song, and Chords created by the Chord
		Composer.  'Cathys Clown - Reba McIntire'.  Automatically
		turns on Midi Clock output for a drum machine.  Turn it off
		under PLAY menu and turn on DRUMMER under DRUM menu.  Start
		song and press keys 1-9 (not on keypad) to hear drummer.
		Each is a 1 bar pattern (0=mute).  Note: status of DRUMMER
		and MIDICLOCK on/off is saved with all .SNG files.  The next
		song will turn them off when it is loaded automatically.

CONCERTO.SNG	Sample Song File  A friends work. Concerto in E Minor Chopin
		that uses controllers, and specifically an example of using
		the 'editable' controller set up for Sostenuto (#66).  It
		was a first attempt at a 'fully' orchestrated piece for him.

DANCE_HR.SNG	Sample Song File   Sets up Controllers, has Key and Tempo
		Changes, example of 'cute' voicing of a Classical Tune.
		'Dance of the Hours - Ponchielli'  Be sure to watch it
		play with both Scrolling Notes and the Player Pianos.

DEEPURPL.SNG	Sample Song File  Rhythm and Accompaniment 'ported' from
		Band in a Box as an experiment.  'Deep Purple'

EVRYROSE.SNG	Sample Song File  'Everything's Coming Up Roses'  Uses Drum
		patterns 'imported' from Band in a Box.

HAUNTED.SNG	Sample Song File  A short demo of Roland SC55 sound effects
		with a minor sounding 'mystery or haunted' background just
		for fun.  Uses chords created by chord composer.

HOLIDAY.SNG	Sample Song File   'Holiday For Strings - David Rose'
		Demos Roland Strings, Pizzicato, Harp, Piano, Celesta, and
		Choir Aahs.  A bit amateurish, I know.

LGHTFIRE.SNG	Sample Song File   'Light My Fire'   Another song good for
		checking out internal 'experimental' drummer.  Demos use
		of several Roland voices.

MEDITATT.SNG	Sample Song File   4 Part Piano and Strings.  Use of
		Controllers, Damper Pedal, Fortes, Auto Tempo, Chords,
		and Accents.  'Auto Tempo' inserted random Tempo Changes to
		simulate a live player.  'Meditation from Thais - Massenet'

WARSAW_3.SNG	Sample Song File    Complete 'Warsaw Concerto' Piano Solo.
		Demonstrates use of Loudness (global), Fortes, Damper Ped.
		and other controllers, Auto Tempo, and Key Changes in Song.
		Has 4400 music columns and took me a week to enter! Enjoy!

WARVUBIN.SNG	Sample Song File   'Kathy Mattea's   Where've You Been'
		Uses Chords, Damper Pedal, Fortes, etc.  Popular Country.

BABYFACE.MID	Sample Midi File   'Baby Face' Piano Solo that sounds as
		though it probably came from a Piano Roll.  Nicely done.

JAZZLAGN.MID	Sample Midi File   'Jazz Lagoon' demo song in a Roland SC55.
		Great example of Brass Section.  Watch Bender on the Piano
		Midi Screen to see why the Brass sounds so realistic.  Press
		<V> key to swap Preset for Controller Display and use Left
		Arrow repeatedly until 'Bender' Shows above Big Slider Ctrl.
		If PLAY.MID opens Midi Parameter Screen, press <S> to swap.

LEYASONG.MID	Sample Midi File   'Leya's Song' another SC55 demo song.
		Example use of 'Fret Noise' voice to make a very realistic
		sounding Guitar.  Also uses the 'Voice Oohs' Patch.

MEDITATT.MID	Sample Midi File   Same as .SNG above, but this is the .MID
		version 'saved' as a MidiFile from within program.

SINGING.MID	Sample Midi Karaoke File  'Singin' In The Rain'  Play this
		on the Piano Screen after pressing <K> to toggle Karaoke
		Mode on (1 Keyboard & KARAOKE shows in Controller Box).
		Use Up/Dn Arrows to change Key on the fly.  L/R Shift Keys
		change tempo. <F>=240 BPM <R>=Resume.  HELP key for others.

STARGAME.MID	Sample Midi File    Another Roland Sound Canvas Demo which
		uses RealTime SYSEX messages to animate the LCD Display
		with a flying ship!  Must have a stand alone SC55 to see.
		Short tune is a take off of 'Star Wars' theme.

STB_B_Y.MID	Sample Midi Karaoke File 'Stand By Your Man - Tammy Wynette'
		Watch the 'Expression' controller to see the Pedal Steel
		Guitar sound effect using the JazzGuitar voice.  Also uses
		Bender.  Of course, turn Karaoke on to view lyrics instead.
		Karaoke files can be Cued Up anywhere in middle just as any
		other File.  Drag Big Song Position Slider, then RIGHT click
		the PLAY Button or press <ENTER>.

I have included several other midis and .sng's for fun and demo.

I hope you enjoy!
