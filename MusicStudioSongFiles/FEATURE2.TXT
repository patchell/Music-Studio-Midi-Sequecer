   PROGRAM FEATURES

             The Program is actually two Programs in one!

   The Main Entry point is a Full Featured Song Editor which allows one
   to Create or Copy Sheet Music onto a Grand Staff, Voice and Play it.
   I was inspired to create the Program due to the serious lack of useful
   Midi Functions offered in the older MStudio programs which were very
   popular, but never took full advantage of the Midi Specification.

   The Second Program is a Standard Midi File player and editor, which is
   called from within the Main Program and can be passed a Std. Midi File
   version of the current Song!  It originally started out as a simple
   Midi File Player, but has grown (and is still growing), into a deluxe
   full fledged Sequencer.  You may load and play or edit any Standard
   Midi File now, in any Tick Resolution, with up to 64 Tracks!

   I love to listen to and watch Professionally Created Midi Files on this
   Mini Sequencer because of the entertaining and informative displays.
   It is really easy to Edit the Files also, and more Editting Tools are
   in the works!  I hope you will enjoy the Program as much as I do and
   that you will find it useful in your quest to conquer MIDI!

   The next two pages detail some of the deluxe features of both Programs.
   I have tried to keep the program runable on a One Meg Atari even though
   I have 2.5 Megs of Memory to work with, so that more Atarians might be
   able to use and enjoy it.  This is the First Release to the Public...
