   Entering Music...
A. Start with a Blank Staff by Selecting 'ERASE SONG' from the FILE Menu.
   Menu will Pop-Up when you move above Staffs.  Hold LEFT Button and only
   release it when the item you desire is Highlighted (drag UP and DOWN).
B. Select the starting Key Signature by LEFT Clicking the Key Signature
   Column next to the Bass & Treble Clefs, or use 'SET KEY SIGN' from the
   EDIT Menu.
C. SET the TIME SIGnature under the EDIT Menu and then set a suitable TEMPO.
D. Now is a good time to give the Song a TITLE.  Use CHANGE TITLE (EDIT Menu).
E. Decide what COLORS to use for various PARTS and set up a few initial Voices
   on the Midi Parameters Screen.  LEFT Click the 'M' Box next to the LOUD Box
   to jump to the Midi Parameters Screen.  Set up the Midi Channel, Preset#,
   Octave Range, Velocity and Accents as needed.  Leave Banks at (1) for now.
F. On the Main Screen, select a Voice Color (set above) from the POP-UP pallet.
   Move just above the Staffs and the Pallet will Pop-Up.  LEFT Click a Color.
   You may listen to the Voice by Holding RIGHT Mouse Button and dragging the
   Mouse UP and DOWN the Staffs, or just use the RIGHT Button like a Piano Key.
G. Select the required NOTE DURATION and MODIFIERS (Dot, Sharp, Flat, Etc.).
   LEFT Click a Note from Lower Pallet.  A RIGHT Click 'drops' any Modifiers.
H. Move back to the Staffs and Place Notes to match the Song you are entering.
   LEFT Click to Add or Delete a Note.  RIGHT Click to hear it.  If you place a
   wrong Note, Click it again to Delete it.  You must move away from the Note
   and back to it for Delete to work, but you probably did this anyway!
I. Select Measure BAR or Note TIEs at ends of Color Pallet to add them to
   your song.  LEFT Click to add Bars or Ties, RIGHT Click to return last Note
   or Rest you were using.  Short cut: RIGHT Click on Whole or Half Rest!
J. Continue adding Notes, Rests, Bars, etc. until you have a Measure or two
   of music.  You may PLAY what you have at anytime, to get an idea of how it
   will sound and make Voice, Velocity, or Tempo adjustments.  Either press
   the SpaceBar or LEFT Click the Play Box (a speaker and 2 notes).  Click
   any Button or Press SpaceBar again to Stop.  You may also PLAY from the
   Midi Parameters Screen while you make adjustments.  Your music will keep
   repeating on this screen automatically.
K. When you need to SCROLL the music on the Edit Screen, to add more Columns
   or locate any group, move to the far Right or Left of the Staffs until the
   Green Scroll Arrows appear.  Hold any combination of Mouse Buttons to Scroll.
   LEFT is Slow, RIGHT is Fastest, BOTH gives medium Speed Scrolling.  As the
   song increases in size, you may want to JUMP within the song without using
   Scrolling.  With NO Buttons pressed, move the Mouse back and forth in the
   Message Box (between the Current Column Number and Last Column Number).
   Watch the Current Column change and LEFT Click to JUMP there.  A RIGHT Click
   in this Box will take you to the End of Song, or the Start of a Block if
   one is Selected (Shaded).
L. It is a VERY GOOD idea to SAVE your work often, just in case the Power Co.
   deprives you of Juice, or Heaven forbid, the program crashes!  If the program
   bombs, it will try to save a file called ERROR.SNG if possible.  This would
   be approximately a 32k file.  You may be able to get your work back if it
   was successful.  Just Load ERROR.SNG when you reboot the program.  If you
   can repeat the 'Crash' sequence and will notify me, I will try to TRAP the
   cause in future releases.  The only Crashes I have experienced were Bad
   Song or Midi Files and/or I was trying to Crash the system and succeeded!
