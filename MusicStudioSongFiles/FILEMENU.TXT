The Menu Bar will POP UP when you move to the top of the screen with the
mouse!.  This also displays the color pallet for picking voices.  A short
description of the Menu Items follows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILE MENU:
   LOAD   SONG - Load a Song File for Edit or Playing (.SNG).
   SAVE   SONG - Save the Current Song File to any Drive.
   ERASE  SONG - Clears Current Song and stays in current key.
   APPEND SONG - Appends another Song to the end of the current Song.
                 No Midi Chan or Voice info is copied from Appended File,
                 only Note data, Key, and Tempo (I think).
   SONG-->.MID - Creates a Standard Midi File (format 0) of current song
                 in buffer.  Watch 'message box' for progress: Bar #...
                 When it's done, you get a message box asking if you
                 want to save the file.  You can go to Midi Player and
                 audition it before you save it, otherwise do the save.
   APPEND TEXT - Incomplete function.  You can try out the mini text
                 editor, but it does not append any text, or even allow
                 it to be saved.  The idea was to allow addition of a
                 Song Description, such as more info on it, what synths,
                 etc.  The following function is also a dud, and would
                 have been the reverse of append.
   REMOVE TEXT - See APPEND.  Nothing will happen if you select this.
   LOAD CONFIG - With this, you can load other Midi Configuration Files.
                 The file loaded at boot time is "DEFAULT.CFG".  The
                 configuration editor is where you can tell the program
                 what midi equipment you have connected, and what its
                 voice names are.  Don't overwrite DEFAULT.CFG unless you
                 wish to trash it.  Save it somewhere!  Then you can safely
                 overwrite the old one.  The new one will load at boot time
                 if it is named DEFAULT.CFG, else this function LOAD... is
                 for loading any other you have created and given a new
                 name.  Like: "MY_MIDI.CFG" or "ENSONIQ.CFG"
   SAVE CONFIG - If you make changes to the DEFAULT.CFG in memory, when you
                 leave via the ESC key, you will be asked if you want to
                 save changes.  If you choose YES, this function is called
                 for you.  If you choose NO, then you may do it later with
                 this function (or not at all).
   ----------- - <--- This line actually is a hidden Memory Check!  It will
                 show the ORIG: memory when program was started and the
                 FREE: memory now!  If this gets too low, the program may
                 quit working correctly!
   ** QUIT! ** - This of course will exit the program.  A dialog asks if
                 you have saved all changes first.
