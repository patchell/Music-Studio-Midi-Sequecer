All about TEMPO

   The TEMPO range is 24 to 240 beats per minute.  A Quarter Note gets one
beat.  Press & HOLD the LEFT Button and Drag the Mouse UP or DOWN while
pointing at the number under 'TEMPO'.  The RIGHT Button is the Coarse adjust-
ment.  After Selecting a Column where you would like to Insert a TEMPO CHANGE,
LEFT Click the TEMPO WORD, instead of the Number.  Answer the DIALOGUE BOX
to complete the operation.

   To SELECT a Song COLUMN, move Mouse Cursor (Pointing Hand), to just above
the Message Box and Note Pallet, where it will become a Square Brown Box.
Watch the message displayed.  Click the LEFT Button when you are on the
Column desired and it will be Shaded (Selected).  To Un-Select Column(s),
Click one that is Shaded.

   To FIND all the TEMPO CHANGES in a Song (one at a time), RIGHT Click the
WORD TEMPO.  The search starts with the 'CURRENT' Column displayed.  If a
TEMPOCHANGE is found the display will update showing the TEMPOCHANGE in the
LeftMost Column.

   NOTE: If the Song is to be played at only one TEMPO, then it is not
necessary to Insert a TEMPO CHANGE in the Music.  The Player will use the
TEMPO displayed, which is also Saved as part of a .SNG file.  On Songs with
at least one TEMPOCHG you should Insert the Starting TEMPO as the First
Column in the Song.  This will ensure the correct beginning TEMPO.  The
Displayed TEMPO is updated whenever the Tempo Changes in a Song (Manually or
by Inserted Tempo Columns).

   The TEMPO may be CHANGED WHILE PLAYING.  Use the <S> and <F> keys to make
the Coarse Adjustment or the LEFT/RIGHT SHIFT KEYS for Fine.  TEMPO Changes
in Music will over-ride any manual changes made.  TEMPO will update or change
on the next Column played, so there may be delays when Long Column Timeouts
occur.  Opposite occurs if the Song is Fast with Short Column Durations with
the Fine (Shift Key) adjustment.  Even a Quick Tap of the Shift Keys may over
shoot the desired TEMPO!

   A TEMPO Column may be Deleted by using the Delete Block function found
under the BLOCK Menu.  To Change the Displayed Value of an Inserted Tempo
Column, just Select the Column as detailed above.  Adjust the TEMPO at lower
Left, then LEFT-Click the Word TEMPO as you would to Insert a TEMPO CHANGE.
A Dialogue will ask if you want to CHANGE the TEMPO.  Answer OK to Change it.

   When you have finished a Song and have Inserted Tempos to get just the
right effect, you may want to try the AUTO TEMPO feature.  This function will
attempt to Insert TEMPO Changes every Quarter Beat using a maximum Random
offset entered when it Prompts for Input.  The TEMPOS Inserted will Range
above and below TEMPO Values Inserted in the Music.  Whenever it Finds a
TEMPO CHANGE it will skip the measure it is in to Preserve YOUR changes.

   It will then use that Value as the Base Value for its RANDOM generated
TEMPOS.  You may Input a number from Two to Twenty (2-20) as the Maximum
Offset it will use.  Three to Five seems to produce the best results.  You
will want to be sure you have Saved the Original Song and only work on a Copy
(in Memory).  To Enable the AUTO feature Press the <T> key.  A Dialogue will
tell you to use the Song Timing Check Function.  When you do, it will ask for
the Maximum Offset Desired.  Enter the Number and Press Return.  It will
start the Timing Check (hopefully you have already checked it and know it is
OK!).

   There will be a Delay as it Inserts TEMPO Columns in your Song which will
also increase the number of physical columns in the Song.  It will Disable
itself when DONE, or if you change your mind before starting the Timing
Check, you may Press the <T> key again to Toggle off the feature. If it
speeds up or slows down too much, you can change or delete the Inserted Tempos
as desired.  Hopefully the Random Tempo Changes will soften the Exactness of
Computer Music.
