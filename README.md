# Midi-Song-and-Patch-Editor
This is a simple [cough] Midi Music program that will eventually will include some patch editors for the Yamaha DX7 and TX81z...well, we shall see at least.

This grandfather of this program dates back to around 1987.  Back then all it would do is play song files from a comercial product from Acti-Vision called Music 
Studio.  This program was writen using a K&R C compuiler.  Not even sure if I could even use such an animal these days. 
Oh yes, This was run on an Atari ST.
Then around 2013 I decided to write a program that could also edit and create music files.  Thus was born the gather of this
program.  I wrote that with Visual Studio 6.0 using MFC.  A lot of the old remnents from the Atari program still lived in this
version.
Now we come to this project.  It was atarted in mid 2020 and I wanted to put everything in it except the kitchen sink, 
well, I included that as well, plus more song objects, and patch editors for two of my favorite synths (TX816 and the TX81z).  My other 
favorite is the Nord Modular, but writing a patch editor for that is just not feasable.
Thire is also going to be some stuff for the Launch Pad Pro, Launch Key 25, and the Launch Control.

Also, I hope, newbies will find this code helpful in learning to program desktop applications using Visual Studio and 
the MFC library.  The program just keeps growing and growing.  Almost like the "Blob".
